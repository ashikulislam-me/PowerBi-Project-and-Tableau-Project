## **Analyzing Sales and Shipping Data**<br>
### **Problem Statement** <br>
This dashboard provides insights into sales and shipping performance across different countries and product categories. The objective is to identify trends in the number of boxes shipped, fluctuations in sales revenue over time, and the contribution of each product to total sales. Additionally, tracking revenue growth and declines over various periods is crucial for strategic decision-making. The main challenge lies in identifying patterns, optimizing logistics, and improving product distribution to enhance overall efficiency and profitability.<br>

## <ins>Tableau Project</ins>
## **Visualizing Sales Data**<br>
### **Getting Started with Tableau** <br>
I found Tableau incredibly easy to use, thanks to its intuitive interface. To begin, I imported sales data, which included monthly sales figures along with subcategories like technology, office supplies, and furniture. The drag-and-drop functionality made it simple to create visualizations without requiring extensive coding knowledge.<br>
### **Dashboards and Key Insights** <br>
<ins>Dashboard 1: Monthly Sales</ins><br>
This graph illustrates the monthly sales trends for three major product categories: technology, office supplies, and furniture. Each category is represented separately, with colored lines depicting sales patterns from 2018 to 2021. The y-axis represents sales figures, while the x-axis tracks the months from January to December. Sales of furniture show a steady increase throughout the year, peaking towards the end, whereas office supplies maintain a relatively stable trend with occasional fluctuations. In contrast, technology sales are the most unpredictable, experiencing sharp rises and drops over time. This visualization provides a clear comparison of how sales trends evolve across different years and product categories, helping businesses identify patterns and make informed decisions.<br>

### **Key Takeaways** <br>
ðŸ”¹ Technology products (especially phones and accessories) consistently perform well, making them a crucial revenue driver.<br>
ðŸ”¹ Seasonal trends are evidentâ€”certain months see higher sales than others.<br>
ðŸ”¹ Businesses should focus on high-performing categories while also addressing fluctuations in demand.<br>
### **Challenges and Learning Experience** <br>
Although Tableau is user-friendly, I encountered some challenges, especially while working with large datasets. Maintaining data accuracy and consistency was essential for meaningful insights. Additionally, I learned how choosing the right visualization type is critical for effectively communicating data stories.<br>
